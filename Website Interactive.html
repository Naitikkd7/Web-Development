            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India is 10:3. Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood
                education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies
                significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste,
                religion, language, and disability.

                Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality,
                reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning
                outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and
                technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming Education in India using AI</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The use of artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots, and other similar
                technologies has the potential to significantly transform education in a variety of ways. Here are a few
                possible examples:<br>
                1.<u><b>Personalized learning:</u></b> Personalized learning: AI can be used to create personalized
                learning experiences tailored to the needs
                of individual students. For example, an AI-powered chatbot can provide instant feedback and support to
                students as they work through problems or assignments, helping them to identify their strengths and
                weaknesses and adjust their learning accordingly.<br>
                2.<u><b>Enhanced student engagement:</u></b> Chatbots and other conversational AI technologies can make
                learning more
                engaging and interactive for students. By providing students with an immersive and personalized learning
                experience, they can improve student engagement and retention.<br>
                3.<u><b>Improved administrative efficiency:</u></b> AI can also be used to automate administrative
                tasks, such as
                grading and scheduling, which can free up teachers' time and allow them to focus on more important tasks
                like lesson planning and providing support to students.<br>
                4.<u><b>Accessible education:</u></b> AI-powered technologies can also help to make education more
                accessible to a wider
                range of students. For example, text-to-speech and speech-to-text software can help students with
                disabilities to access learning materials more easily. </p>
